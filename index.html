            <p>One of my favorite hobbys are drawing. I've loved to draw for years. I started drawing at around 4. I would love to draw all the time. I always practiced to become better. At around the age of 7, I became better. My drawings were always a bit blocky though. I would search up tutorials to help me get better. At the age of 9, I got more better. I would practice drawing all the time. In the morning when I had time to night when I had to go t bed. Now at the age of 11, I am happy with how I draw. I have more headshape to it and I started to draw my pictures 3d. I can draw little cartoon people. It can be both anime or cartoons though but it looks more like cartoons. I keep practicing to get better. One of my dreams is to become an artist and show all of my drawings to the world. I have many dreams that I want to accomplish and becoming an artist is definitely one of them. </p>
